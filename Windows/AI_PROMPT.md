# ACE RFID Project AI Prompt

## Project Overview

ACE RFID is a Mac Catalyst desktop application built with Swift and Xcode, designed for managing RFID card operations. It leverages native macOS frameworks and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with RFID readers, handling card data, and managing filament information via a local database.

### Key Components

- **MainViewController**: The primary user interface, handling card reader events, displaying card UID, and providing options for auto-reading and auto-writing tags.
- **RFIDReader**: Encapsulates low-level RFID operations such as reading UID, reading/writing binary blocks, and fetching firmware version from the card reader using macOS APIs.
- **FilamentDB**: Manages filament data storage and retrieval using a local database (e.g., Core Data or SQLite), supporting add, update, and query operations.
- **AppDelegate**: Application entry point, sets up the environment and launches the main view controller.

### Features

- Real-time monitoring of RFID card insertion/removal.
- Reading and writing card data blocks.
- Displaying card UID and firmware version.
- Managing filament information in a local database.
- Tooltips and UI feedback for enhanced user experience.
- Error handling for device and data operations.
