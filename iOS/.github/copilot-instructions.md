# ACE RFID iOS App Instructions

This is a fully functional iOS Swift project for managing 3D printing filament using RFID/NFC tags for Anycubic ACE 3D printers. The app is complete and ready for production use.

## Project Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

The app successfully builds and runs on both iOS simulator and device. All core functionality has been implemented, tested, and verified with successful builds. The project is ready for App Store deployment.

## Architecture & Technologies

- **Language**: Swift 5.0+ with iOS 13.0+ minimum deployment target
- **UI Framework**: UIKit with programmatic layout (no Storyboards except LaunchScreen)
- **Architecture**: MVC pattern with clear separation of concerns
- **Data Persistence**: Core Data with FilamentDataModel
- **NFC**: Core NFC framework (requires paid Apple Developer account for device testing)
- **Project Structure**: Organized folders (Models, Views, Controllers, Services, Core Data, Resources)

## Implemented Features ✅

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Filament Management**: Full CRUD operations for filament records
- ✅ **NFC Integration**: Read/write filament data to/from NFC tags (device only)
- ✅ **Core Data Persistence**: Local database with proper data modeling
- ✅ **Material-Specific Defaults**: Intelligent temperature and speed suggestions

### Enhanced User Experience ✅
- ✅ **Brand Management**: 18 predefined brands + "Generic" option + custom brand addition
- ✅ **Smart Color Selection**: 23 common colors with visual color swatches and UIColor mapping
- ✅ **Material Intelligence**: 10 material types with automatic default temperature/speed settings
- ✅ **Intelligent Defaults**: Auto-populated weight (1000g), diameter (1.75mm), and material-specific settings
- ✅ **Advanced Input Validation**: Integer-only weight input, decimal diameter with proper locale handling
- ✅ **Professional UI/UX**: Picker toolbars, keyboard management, responsive layouts, accessibility support

### Data Model
- ✅ **Filament Struct**: Complete model with all necessary properties
- ✅ **Brand Enum**: 18 popular 3D printing filament brands
- ✅ **Material Enum**: Material types with specific default settings
- ✅ **Color Enum**: Color palette with UIColor mappings for visual swatches
- ✅ **JSON Serialization**: For NFC tag data storage and retrieval

### NFC Capabilities
- ✅ **NFC Service**: Complete implementation with proper error handling
- ✅ **Simulator Support**: Mock methods for testing without NFC hardware
- ✅ **Device Detection**: Context-aware messages for different environments
- ✅ **Entitlements**: Configured for both free and paid developer accounts

## Key Files & Components

### Models
- `Filament.swift` - Complete data model with enums for Brand, Material, Color
- `CoreDataManager.swift` - Core Data stack management and operations

### Views
- `FilamentTableViewCell.swift` - Custom table view cell for filament display
- `MainViewController.swift` - Primary interface with table view and NFC controls
- `AddEditFilamentViewController.swift` - Form interface with advanced pickers

### Services
